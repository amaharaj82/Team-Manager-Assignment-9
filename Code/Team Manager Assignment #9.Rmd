This is a study of the relationship of income to ethnicity using a sample of American workers. In this study I want to determine if there is a difference in the average income of workers of different ethnic backgrounds after adjusting for years of education.

```{r include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)

income <- read_csv(here("Data", "Ethnic Income Data.csv"))

income$Race <- factor(income$Race,
                      levels = c("b", "h", "w"),
                      labels = c("Black", "Hispanic", "White"))

```
